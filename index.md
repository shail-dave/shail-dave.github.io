Hello! Welcome to my webpage. I am a graduate student in [Computer Engineering](https://engineering.asu.edu/cen/) at [School of Computing, Informatics, and Decisions Systems Engineering](https://cidse.engineering.asu.edu) (CIDSE), [Arizona State University](http://www.asu.edu/) (ASU) beginning Spring 2017. Prior joining the doctoral program, I earned my master's at ASU in Computer Engineering in 2016. My [research](https://sites.google.com/view/shail/professional-ex#Research) at [Compiler Micro-architecture Lab](http://aviral.lab.asu.edu/) (CML)@ASU is advised by [Prof. Aviral Shrivastava](http://aviral.lab.asu.edu/) and it targets  developing compiler support and (micro)architecture design for [Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Arrays](http://aviral.lab.asu.edu/?page_id=1533) (CGRAs).  CGRA is an energy-efficient accelerator that can speed-up even non-vectorizable performance-critical loops. Moreover, my research interests include:
* Programmable Accelerators
* Compiler Design
* Deep Learning
