Hello! <img align="left" src="https://webapp4.asu.edu/photo-ws/directory_photo/sjdave?blankImage=false&size=medium" hspace="20"> I am a graduate student in [School of Computing and AI](https://scai.engineering.asu.edu/) at [Arizona State University](http://www.asu.edu/) since 2017. Prior joining the doctoral program, I earned my master's at ASU in 2016. My [research](https://sites.google.com/view/shail/professional-ex#Research) at [Compiler Micro-architecture Lab](http://aviral.lab.asu.edu/) is advised by [Prof. Aviral Shrivastava](http://aviral.lab.asu.edu/aviral-shrivastava/) and it targets developing compiler support and (micro)architecture design for [Reconfigurable Hardware Accelerators](https://labs.engineering.asu.edu/mps-lab/research/ml-accelerators/). My research interests and experiences include Design Automation, Computer Architecture, Compiler Design and Optimizations, Embedded and Cyber-Phsyiscal Systems, and Deep Learning Model Compression.
